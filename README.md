## About

Lint rules are a powerful way to improve the maintainability of a project.
The more, the merrier!
But while Dart offers a wide variety of lint rules by default, it cannot
reasonably include every possible lint. For example, Dart does not
include lints related to third-party packages.

Custom_lint fixes that by allowing package authors to write custom lint rules.

Custom_lint is similar to [analyzer_plugin], but goes deeper by trying to
provide a better developer experience.

That includes:

- A command-line to obtain the list of lints in your CI
  without having to write a command line yourself.
- A simplified project setup:
  No need to deal with the `analyzer` server or error handling. Custom_lint
  takes care of that for you, so that you can focus on writing lints.
- Debugger support.
  Inspect your lints using the Dart debugger and place breakpoints.
- Supports hot-reload/hot-restart:
  Updating the source code of a linter plugin will dynamically restart it,
  without having to restart your IDE/analyzer server.
- Built-in support for `// ignore:` and `// ignore_for_file:`.
- Built-in testing mechanism using `// expect_lint`. See [Testing your plugins](#testing-your-plugins)
- Support for `print(...)` and exceptions:
  If your plugin somehow throws or print debug messages, custom_lint
  will generate a log file with the messages/errors.

## Usage

Using custom_lint is split in two parts:

- how to define a custom_lint package
- how users can install our package in their application to see our newly defined lints

### Creating a custom lint package

To create a custom lint, you will need two things:

- updating your `pubspec.yaml` to include `custom_lint_builder` as a dependency:

  ```yaml
  # pubspec.yaml
  name: my_custom_lint_package
  environment:
    sdk: ">=3.0.0 <4.0.0"

  dependencies:
    # we will use analyzer for inspecting Dart files
    analyzer:
    analyzer_plugin:
    # custom_lint_builder will give us tools for writing lints
    custom_lint_builder:
  ```

- create a `lib/<my_package_name>.dart` file in your project with the following:

  ```dart
  // This is the entrypoint of our custom linter
  PluginBase createPlugin() => _ExampleLinter();

  /// A plugin class is used to list all the assists/lints defined by a plugin.
  class _ExampleLinter extends PluginBase {
    /// We list all the custom warnings/infos/errors
    @override
    List<LintRule> getLintRules(CustomLintConfigs configs) => [
          MyCustomLintCode(),
        ];
  }

  class MyCustomLintCode extends DartLintRule {
    MyCustomLintCode() : super(code: _code);

    /// Metadata about the warning that will show-up in the IDE.
    /// This is used for `// ignore: code` and enabling/disabling the lint
    static const _code = LintCode(
      name: 'my_custom_lint_code',
      problemMessage: 'This is the description of our custom lint',
    );

    @override
    void run(
      CustomLintResolver resolver,
      ErrorReporter reporter,
      CustomLintContext context,
    ) {
      // Our lint will highlight all variable declarations with our custom warning.
      context.registry.addVariableDeclaration((node) {
        // "node" exposes metadata about the variable declaration. We could
        // check "node" to show the lint only in some conditions.

        // This line tells custom_lint to render a waring at the location of "node".
        // And the warning shown will use our `code` variable defined above as description.
        reporter.reportErrorForNode(code, node);
      });
    }
  }
  ```

That's it for defining a custom lint package!

If you're looking for a more advanced example, see the [example](https://github.com/invertase/dart_custom_lint/tree/main/packages/custom_lint/example).
This example implements:

- a lint appearing on all variables of a specific type
- a quick fix for that lint
- an "assist" for providing refactoring options.

Let's now use it in an application.

### Using our custom lint package in an application

For users to run custom_lint packages, there are a few steps:

- The application must contain an `analysis_options.yaml` with the following:

  ```yaml
  analyzer:
    plugins:
      - custom_lint
  ```

- The application also needs to add `custom_lint` and our package(s) as dev
  dependency in their application:

  ```yaml
  # The pubspec.yaml of an application using our lints
  name: example_app
  environment:
    sdk: ">=3.0.0 <4.0.0"

  dev_dependencies:
    custom_lint:
    my_custom_lint_package:
  ```

That's all!
After running `pub get` (and possibly restarting their IDE), users should now
see our custom lints in their Dart files:

### Enabling/disabling and configuring lints

By default, custom_lint enables all installed lints.  
But chances are you may want to disable one specific lint,
or alternatively, disable all lints besides a few.

This configuration is done in your `analysis_options.yaml`,
but in a slightly different manner.

Configurations are placed within a `custom_lint` object, as
followed:

```yaml
analyzer:
  plugins:
    - custom_lint

custom_lint:
  rules:
    - my_lint_rule: false # disable this rule
```

As mentioned before, all lints are enabled by default.

```yaml
custom_lint:
  # Disable all lints by default
  enable_all_lint_rules: false
  rules:
    - my_lint_rule # only enable my_lint_rule
```

If you want to change this, you can optionally disable
all lints by default:

Last but not least, some lint rules may be configurable.
When a lint is configurable, you can configure it in the same place with:

```yaml
custom_lint:
  rules:
    - my_lint_rule:
      some_parameter: "some value"
```

### Obtaining the list of lints in the CI

Unfortunately, running `dart analyze` does not pick up our newly defined lints.
We need a separate command for this.

To do that, users of our custom lint package can run the following inside their terminal:

```sh
$ dart run custom_lint
  lib/main.dart:0:0 • This is the description of our custom lint • my_custom_lint_code
```

If you are working on a Flutter project, run `flutter pub run custom_lint` instead.

### Using the Dart debugger

To debug plugins in custom_lint, you need to connect to plugins using "attach"
mode in your IDE (`cmd+shift+p` + `Debug: attach to Dart process` in VSCode).

When using this command, you will need a VM service URI provided by custom_lint.

There are two possible ways to obtain one:

- if you started your plugin using `custom_lint --watch`, it should be visible
  in the console output.
- if your plugin is started by your IDE, you can open the `custom_lint.log` file
  that custom_lint created next to the `pubspec.yaml` of your analyzed projects.

In both cases, what you're looking for is logs similar to:

```
The Dart VM service is listening on http://127.0.0.1:60671/9DS43lRMY90=/
The Dart DevTools debugger and profiler is available at: http://127.0.0.1:60671/9DS43lRMY90=/devtools/#/?uri=ws%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A60671%2F9DS43lRMY90%3D%2Fws
```

What you'll want is the first URI. In this example, that is `http://127.0.0.1:60671/9DS43lRMY90=/`.
You can then pass this to your IDE, which should now be able to attach to the
plugin.

### Testing your plugins

#### Testing lints

Custom_lint comes with an official testing mechanism for asserting that your
plugins correctly work.

Testing lints is straightforward: Simply write a file that should contain
lints from your plugin (such as the example folder). Then, using a syntax
similar to `// ignore`, write a `// expect_lint: code` in the line before
your lint:

```dart
// expect_lint: riverpod_final_provider
var provider = Provider(...);
```

When doing this, there are two possible cases:

- The line after the `expect_lint` correctly contains the expected lint.
  In that case, the lint is ignored (similarly to if we used `// ignore`)
- The next line does **not** contain the lint.
  In that case, the `expect_lint` comment will have an error.

This allows testing your plugins by simply running `custom_lint` on your test/example folder.
Then, if any expected lint is missing, the command will fail. But if your plugin correctly
emits the lint, the command will succeed.

#### Testing quick fixes and assists

Testing quick fixes and assists is also possible with regular tests by combining them with
`pkg:analyzer` to manually execute the assists or fixes. An example can be found in the
[Riverpod repository](https://github.com/rrousselGit/riverpod/tree/master/packages/riverpod_lint_flutter_test/test/assists).
