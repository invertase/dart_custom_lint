### About

Lint rules are a powerful way to improve the maintainability of a project.
The more, the merrier!  
But while Dart offers a wide variety of lint rules by default, it cannot
reasonably include every possible lint. For example, Dart does not
include lints related to third-party packages.

Custom_lint fixes that by allowing package authors to write custom lint rules.

Custom_lint is similar to [analyzer_plugin], but goes deeper by trying to
provide a better developer experience.

That includes:

- Use custom_lint's command line to obtain the list of lints in your CI â€“
  without having to write a command line yourself.
- A simplified project setup.  
  No need to deal with `analyzer` or error handling. Custom_lint takes care of
  that for you, so that you can focus on writing lints.
- Support for hot-restart.  
  Updating the source code of a linter plugin will dynamically restart it,
  without having to restart your IDE/analyzer server
- Support for `print(...)` and exceptions.  
  If your plugin somehow throws or print debug messages, custom_lint
  will generate a log file with the messages/errors.
