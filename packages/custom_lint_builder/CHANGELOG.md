**Large Breaking change**
This new version introduces large changes to how lints/fixes/assists are defined.  
Long story short, besides the `createPlugin` method, the entire syntax changed.

See the readme, examples, and docs around how to use the new syntax.

The new syntax has multiple benefits:

- It is now possible to enable/disable lints inside the `analysis_options.yaml`
  as followed:

  ```yaml
  # optional
  include: path/to/another/analysis_options.yaml

  custom_lint:
    rules:
      # enable a lint rule
      - my_lint_rule
      # A lint rule that is explicitly disabled
      - another_lint_rule: false
  ```

  Enabling/disabling lints is supported by default with the new syntax. Nothing to do~

- Performance improvement when using a large number of lints.
  The workload of analyzing files is now shared between lints.

- The new syntax makes the code simpler to maintain.
  Before, the `PluginBase.getLints` rapidly ended-up doing too much.
  Now, it is simple to split the implementation in multiple bits

## 0.1.2-dev

Do some internal refactoring as an attempt to fix #60

## 0.1.1

- Fix an issue where plugins were hot-reloaded when the file analyzed changed.
- Optimized analysis such that `PluginBase.getLints()` is theorically not reinvoked
  unless the file analyzed changed.

## 0.1.0

- **Breaking**: The plugin entrypoint has moved.  
  Plugins no-longer should define a `/bin/custom_lint.dart` file.
  Instead they should define a `/lib/<my_package_name>.dart`

- **Breaking**: The plugin entrypoint is modified. Plugins no-longer
  define a "main", but instead define a `createPlugin` function:

  Before:

  ```dart
  // /bin/custom_lint.dart
  void main(List<String> args, SendPort sendPort) {
    startPlugin(sendPort, MyPlugin());
  }
  ```

  After:

  ```dart
  // /lib/<my_package_name.dart
  MyPlugin createPlugin() => MyPlugin();
  ```

- Add assist support.
  Inside your plugins, you can now override `handleGetAssists`:

  ```dart
  import 'package:analyzer_plugin/protocol/protocol_generated.dart'
    as analyzer_plugin;

  class MyPlugin extends PluginBase {
    // ...

    Future<analyzer_plugin.EditGetAssistsResult> handleGetAssists(
      ResolvedUnitResult resolvedUnitResult, {
      required int offset,
      required int length,
    }) async {
        // TODO return some assists for the given offset
    }
  }
  ```

## 0.0.16

Fix `expect_lint` not working if the file doesn't contain any lint.

## 0.0.15

- Custom_lint now has a built-in mechanism for testing lints.
  Simply write a file that should contain lints for your plugin.
  Then, using a syntax similar to `// ignore`, write a `// expect_lint: code`
  in the line before your lint:

  ```dart
  // expect_lint: riverpod_final_provider
  var provider = Provider(...);
  ```

  When doing this, there are two possible cases:

  - The line after the `expect_lint` correctly contains the expected lint.  
    In that case, the lint is ignored (similarly to if we used `// ignore`)
  - The next line does **not** contain the lint.
    In that case, the `expect_lint` comment will have an error.

  This allows testing your plugins by simply running `custom_lint` on your test/example folder.
  Then, if any expected lint is missing, the command will fail. But if your plugin correctly
  emits the lint, the command will succeed.
